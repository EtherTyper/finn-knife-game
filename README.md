Move Finn left and right to avoid being killed by the Falling Sky Knives in this awesome SpriteKit template. Free to use and free to play from the monkeys behind the curtain. (Animator Joe)

# License
This game uses a free Apache 2.0 license, because we want you enjoy building the program as much as we did. It uses a graphic of “Gomez” from the game Fez as its foe, and the SpriteKit library from Apple. We cannot thank these unknowing contributors enough, as their work is crucial to our project.
