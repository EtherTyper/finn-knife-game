This game uses a free Apache 2.0 license, because we want you enjoy building the program as much as we did. It uses many different libraries to form its unique gameplay style and identity, including a graphic of “Gomez” from the game Fez as its foe, and the SpriteKit library from Apple. We cannot thank these unknowing contributors enough, as their work is crucial to our project. Here is a complete table:
